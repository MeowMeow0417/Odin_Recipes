        <p>these amounts of ingrerdients can make about 15-20 Brownies</p>
    <div>

            <li>200g butter, diced, plus extra for greasing</li>
            <li>175g caster sugar</li>
            <li>125g light soft brown sugar</li>
            <li>4 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>115g plain flour</li>
            <li>Pinch of sea salt</li>
            <li>100g dark chocolate, chopped into small chunks (optional)</li>
        </ul> 
    </div>
        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/160°C fan/Gas 4. Grease and line a 30 x 23cm cake tin with baking parchment.</li>
            <li>Put the chocolate and butter into a large heatproof bowl set over a pan of gently simmering water (don't let the bottom of the bowl touch the water underneath) and leave until melted, stirring occasionally (see Tips). </li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and cool the chocolate down by whisking in the sugars using a balloon whisk. Add the eggs and vanilla extract and mix in with a wooden spoon until combined. Sift over the flour and salt and stir again until smooth and combined. Pour into the prepared tin, smoothing the top level. </li> 
            <li>Bake for 35-40 minutes, until cracked around the edges and soft in the middle (it will firm up as it cools), rotating the tin halfway through baking. </li>
            <li>If you are adding the chocolate chunks, take the brownie out of the oven after 20 minutes and vigorously throw the chunks of chocolate at the half-baked brownie so they break the surface. Return to the oven for the remaining cooking time. </li>
            <li>Transfer the brownie to a wire rack and leave it to cool in the tin, then cut into squares before serving. Once cooled, the brownies will keep in an airtight container for up to a week. Alternatively, cool the cooked brownie in the tin for 10 minutes, then cut into squares and serve warm with a dollop of thick cream.</li>
